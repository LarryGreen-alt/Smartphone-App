# Introduction
This document outlines the interesting creation process of a Native React smartphone app that I developed using online resources. The project involved combining both soft and hard skills to bring the app to life. Below, I'll discuss the app's concept, the technologies used, and the skills required to accomplish this project.

# App Concept
This Native React app is designed as a personalized Tesla Delievery application. It allows users to view several Tesla automobiles with their associated name, model, price, and tagline from their phones. The app currently provides an intuivitve user interface of buttons, non-interactive menu, and seamless intergration and scrolling.

# Technology Used
- Latest Node.JS: The primary programming language for building the app's logic and functionality.
- Android Studio Software for Emulation (An Alternative would to uses the Expo Go app. More about it is explained in this link: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/)
- Expo:  A powerful toolchain that simplifies React Native development, allowing for easier testing and deployment.
- React Native: The core framework used to develop a cross-platform mobile application compatible with smartphones.

# Soft Skills
- Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, intergrating from prior experiences with Javascript, learning new tools such a Andrioid Studio and React Native. Effective problem-solving skills were crucial in overcoming these hurdles.
- Adaptability: The world of mobile app development is constantly evolving, and staying updated with the latest technologies and trends is crucial. Being adaptable and open to learning new tools and techniques was necessary to ensure the app's relevance and efficiency.

# Hard Skills
- React Native Development: Proficiency in React Native was fundamental to building the app's user interface and implementing various features.
- Frontend Development: Strong frontend development skills were essential for creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using React Native.
- Self-Starter - I wanted to learn about app development and understand its process at a low level.
